# Testing documentation

Unfortunately, testing for this application is somewhat lacking. Reasons include lack of time, not-so-test-driven-developement, among other things. Some tests have been written for some of the more central game objects, as well as the GameStateService. Some very basic Dao tests were also written.  

### Code coverage

Code coverage of the testing sits at around 50%, which is a bit low. There are 18 tests in total.
