# Usage instructions

These are the short-and-to-the-point usage instructions for installing and playing this game.

## Installation

Please see the main page for latest .jar releases and/or instruction on compiling and running from source.

## Configuration

No additional configuration files are necessary. The game uses a single file for SQLite database, but this file will be created automatically when the game is launched if it does not exsist. The file is created in the same folder where the game (e.g. the .jar file) was launched from. There should not be need for giving write access for the application, however if this happens, do give them by referring to your OS's manual/forum/etc.


## Choosing a player or creating a new player
 
From the main menu, choose the Player menu. From there, you can choose from existing players, or create new player by typing a name in the text field above and clicking "Add player". A new player with that name will be added to the database. To choose a player, click on that player on the list, then click "Select player" at the bottom. You can delete players the same way by clicking the Delete button.

## Viewing high score

From the main menu, choose High score. This will open a new menu, where you can see all scores attained from the game, from highest to lowest. Other information include the game time, date the score was achieved and the player who deserves credit for it.

## Starting a new game & playing the game

Start a new game by clicking New game. This will move you to the game view.

Controls: mouse to control the paddle, ESC to pause game and go to the main menu.

In this game, your goal is to use the paddle at the bottom to bounce a moving ball to hit the bricks above. Hitting a brick will destroy it. You will want to destroy as many bricks as possible, preferably all of them. Each broken brick will yield a certain amount of points to your total score (shown at the top left among other information). The yellow bricks at the top array are most valuable, while the red ones at the bottom are least valuable.

You must try to keep the ball from ever falling out of the game area. You have three (3) balls in total. Once those are used, the game will end (unless you managed to break all the bricks before that, which also ends the game).

The game will get progressively harder as you gain more points: the ball speed increases and the width of your paddle decreases. You can direct the ball by hitting it with different parts of the paddle: hit it with leftmost part and it will fly left, hit it with the center part and it will fly straight up, and so on. The angle at which it hits the paddle has no effect on the direction, only that where it hits the paddle!
